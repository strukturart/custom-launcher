		}
	},

	{
		"weather":
		{
			"owm_api_key":"6d385b079ea964532d681348",
		
			"location":
			{
				"br√ºssel":
				{
					"position_lat":" 50.846557",
					"position_long":"4.3516970"

				},

	}
]

```

5. you can also nest the apps in folders, "you": "myDir". They have to be put in order DirA, DirA, DirB, DirB as in my example.
6. if you want the weather forecast feature get your own api key from [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org) and put the api-key in "owm_api_key". You can set your default locations. Press soft-left to select your location.
